Abstract
======

 We introduce the French Land cover from Aerospace ImageRy (FLAIR), an extensive dataset from the French National Institute of Geographical and Forest Information (IGN) that provides a unique and rich resource for large-scale geospatial analysis. FLAIR contains high-resolution aerial imagery with a ground sample distance of 20 cm and over 20 billion individually labeled pixels for precise land-cover classification. The dataset also integrates temporal and spectral data from optical satellite time series.  FLAIR thus combines data with varying spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions across over 817\:km$^2$ of acquisitions representing the full landscape diversity of France. This diversity makes FLAIR a valuable resource for the development and evaluation of novel methods for large-scale land-cover semantic segmentation and raises significant challenges in terms of computer vision, data fusion, and geospatial analysis. We also provide powerful uni- and multi-sensor baseline models that can be employed to assess algorithm's performance and for downstream applications.  Through its extent and the quality of its annotation, FLAIR aims to spur improvements in monitoring and understanding key anthropogenic development indicators such as urban growth, deforestation, and soil artificialization.
